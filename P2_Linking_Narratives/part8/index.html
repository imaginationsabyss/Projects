	<p>I felt
the earth <a href="../part9/index.html">cool.</a> I felt the fires lit so those of us who survived
could go on living. I felt the beasts arrive when night was confirmed.
You killed us off. You felt youâ€™d earned it, the right to make us
into what fears and what crouches and what grows cold. I could not
grow older.
